                <p className="disc">Tech Wheels is a term that refers to the intersection
                    of technology and the automotive industry. It encompasses various advancements and innovations in
                    the automotive sector, particularly in the areas of connected cars, autonomous vehicles, electric
                    vehicles (EVs), and smart transportation systems.
                    Connected cars are vehicles that utilize internet connectivity and integrated sensors to gather and
                    share data. These cars can communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and external systems to
                    provide real-time information about traffic, road conditions, and navigation. They often have
                    features like Wi-Fi connectivity, advanced infotainment systems, and remote vehicle monitoring and
                    control.
                    Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars or driverless cars, are an integral part of the
                    tech wheels domain. They rely on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and a network of
                    sensors, cameras, and radar systems to navigate and operate without human intervention. Autonomous
                    vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation by increasing safety, reducing traffic
                    congestion, and improving fuel efficiency.
